"""
In dt.py, you will implement a basic decision tree classifier for
binary classification.  Your implementation should be based on the
minimum classification error heuristic (even though this isn't ideal,
it's easier to code than the information-based metrics).

        Some hints/suggestions:
          - make sure you don't build the tree deeper than self.opts['maxDepth']
          
          - make sure you don't try to reuse features (this could lead
            to very deep trees that keep splitting on the same feature
            over and over again)
            
          - it is very useful to be able to 'split' matrices and vectors:
            if you want the ids for all the Xs for which the 5th feature is
            on, say X(:,5)>=0.5.  If you want the corresponting classes,
            say Y(X(:,5)>=0.5) and if you want the correspnding rows of X,
            say X(X(:,5)>=0.5,:)
            
          - i suggest having train() just call a second function that
            takes additional arguments telling us how much more depth we
            have left and what features we've used already

          - take a look at the 'mode' and 'uniq' functions in util.py
